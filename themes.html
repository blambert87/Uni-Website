		<h2>Religious Hypocrisy</h2>

				<section>
					<p>Tartuffe has many themes throughout the play. The main theme explored in this play is religious hypocrisy. This is the central theme. 
					Tartuffe is a religious hypocrite. The play is centered around this religious hypocrite and his relationship with Orgon and his 
					family. Orgon is the main character in the play. Orgon and his mother, Madame Pernelle, believe Tartuffe is everything he says he 
					is and more. They’re both blinded by his façade. Orgons family, however, see right through him and his religious hypocrisy. The 
					family spends a lot of time trying to reason and convince Orgon that Tartuffe is a hypocrite. Elmire, the wife of Orgon, finds a 
					way to expose Tartuffe for the hypocrite that he is. She sets a trap for him in a room where Orgon is hiding under the table. She 
					is able to expose Tartuffe through conversation and Orgon’s eyes are open to the lies for the first time. After Orgon kicks Tartuffe 
					out of his house, Tartuffe tries to black mail Orgon and get him arrested. Orgon then tries to tell his mom that Tartuffe is a hypocrite
					and she doesn’t believe Orgon even after his radical change of heart towards Tartuffe. Orgon is now in his families’ shoes and gets a taste 
					of his own medicine.</p>
