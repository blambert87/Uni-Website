				<p><em>Tartuffe</em> is a French play written in 1664 by Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, who went by the stage name of Moliere. 
				The play is about a religious hypocrite named Tartuffe and his relationship with a family. This play consists of 
				many themes that unfold throughout the play from beginning to end. <em>Tartuffe</em> has a unique writing style to it. There 
				are many differences between a play writing style and how a story is written. The social context and historical 
				time period play a part in the story as well. The significance of the social context and historical time period will be examined further. </p>

				<p>There is a unique writing style to <em>Tartuffe</em> that Moliere incorporates. <em>Tartuffe</em> was originally written in French. Each line in <em>Tartuffe</em> was 
					twelve syllables long. The last word in every two lines rhyme. After Moliere’s <em>Tartuffe</em> is translated you don’t get the perfect 12 syllable 
					lines but you still get the rhyming. There is another English translation that does not have the rhyming in it. You can have the choice of 
					reading the play in English with rhyming or without rhyming.</p>

				<p>A play is written much differently than how a story is written. The make-up of a story consists of a beginning, middle, and end. The story 
				is divided up by chapters. It is written when it is intended to be read and not performed. When writing a story the author has to use his writing 
				skill to bring to life his characters, build a plot that is revealed in a way that’s believable, establish a setting, build up suspense, and to 
				give an eloquent description that captures the imagination of the reader.</p>

				<p>The characteristics of a play will consist of dialogue and stage direction. Plays are divided up by acts and scenes. They are written to be
				performed and watched. Suspense, characterization, description, and setting are supplied by visuals.</p>
