<h1>Social Context</h1>

	<section class="socialContext">
		<p>Tartuffe was written in 1664. It was during this time history that France was still ruled by a king and the Catholic Church still had a lot 
		of influence and authority in the country as well. The king at this time was Louis XIV, also known as the “Sun King.” King Louis XIV was a very
		important supporter of the literary and visual arts. Moliere’s theatrical company performed for King Louis XIV in 1658. The parti des Devots 
		(party of the faithful) opposed Moliere as he became successful. They came together in order to protest the irreverence by Moliere because Moliere
		was continuing to take on the sacred cows of society. Even though this was going on, the king continued to support and protect Moliere by giving him 
		a pension and allowed him to continue on without being censored as was being demanded by the Church and other conservative groups in society. Moliere
		was becoming very famous as well as infamous. There was an increasing resistance over his works which climaxed in the fury over Tartuffe. The play of 
		Tartuffe was a direct attack on the hypocrisy of piety was so noticeable that the Catholic Church forced the king to ban it.</p>
